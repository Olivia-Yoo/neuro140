# Assessing brain-like activations in convolutional neural networks

Neuro 140 final project, 2023.

I used representational similarity analysis to compare human IT cortex activations in response to natural images with the activations of deep convolutional and residual networks in response to the natural and modified images to determine which layers/architectures are most similar to IT cortex.

## File structure

### `code/`

* `cnns.ipynb`: notebook that implements all six of the neural networks and feeds the images through to generate the layer activations (needs to be run on Colab for GPU access)
* `comparison.ipynb`: notebook that conducts the data analysis comparing the human and CNN data
* `figures.ipynb`: notebook that generates all the final figures for the report
* `human_processing.ipynb`: notebook that retrieves the fMRI data from BrainIAK and generates the human RDMs

### `data/`

* `cnns_data/`: contains all of the network RDMs as `.npy` files
* `colab_data/`: contains the image data and human RDMs/RSMs generated from the `human_processing.ipynb` on colab
* `figures/`: contains all of the figures generated for the final report and supplement
* `kriegeskorte_data/`: contains all the fMRI data generated by Kriegeskorte et al. 2008
* `mapping/`: contains all the data for generating the figures

### `paper/`

* `project_report.pdf`: final project report
* `supplement.pdf`: supplemental material containing all the figures generated for the six networks
